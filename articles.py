In India we have a tradion to respect our food and people who provides food are traditionally treated as gods. 
That why we have many quotes within us like ' ఆన్నం పరభ్రహ్మ స్వరూపం' 
' ఆన్న డాత శుఖీ భవ ', ' ఆన్ని దానాలలోకి ఆన్న దానం గొప్పది '   etc...

Today I would like to talk about one such person who has fed poor people with all the resources they have.' Srimati Dokka Seetamma gaaru ' also known as Annapoornamma(Goddess of food) of godavari districts

In the Delta lands of east godavari where there are frequent floods, Dokka Seetamma gaaru did 'Anna Daanam' through out her life. She should be one of the greatest inspirations for our generation than many ppl who 
just do show off for their politics.

She made sure that no one in her surroundings are sleeping with hunger at any cost. Born in 1841 October, Married early to Sri Dokka Joganna gaaru who is rich farmer she had not just donated food but also donated for 
many marriages functions and events most of that was prepared by her own. We are not sure what made her to do AnnaDaana but through out her life she was just AnnaPoornamma for many people. 

Once she was going for Antarvedi from her native for Temple and had rested for a while on the way she encountered a group of people where she overheard a kid crying that he was hungry and her mother pampering him that they will reach soon to P gannavaram 
and they can have food at Seethamma gaaru, after hearing that she had stopped her journey and returned home to prepare food before the guests have reached. This is just one example of many such things she did.

She was invited to Delhi by King Edward VII to attend his Anniversary but she had rejected the offer saying that she is not doing this for Publicity following which He had put a picture of her in her chair to honor her.

Even when she started her journey to Kaashi to have a peaceful death she had to stop after hearing some one was hungry and then started her journey. 

Althogh Her kids have continued the AnnaDaana they couldnt continue due to no financial aids available at that time. 

She never accepted donations yet managed to feed the need with her last penny. She should be an Inspiration to many and should be remembered for sure.
